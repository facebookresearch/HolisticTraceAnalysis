    "# Critical Path Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical path analysis is a commonly applied technique in HPC and AI/ML optimization. It can be leveraged in two ways:\n",
    "1. **Efficiency opportunities** Operations/kernels on critical path should be the target of performance analysis and optimizations. They can provide the “best bang for buck” for performance improvements.This is not limited to just CPU/GPU kernels. Delays in launching or executing CUDA kernels can constitute a significant portion of the critical path as well. This could be optimized by operator fusion and CUDA graphs for example.\n",
    "2. **Simulating improvements / gains:** After identifying critical path we can estimate improvements to the execution time without actually running anything. This helps us estimate the possible gains from various performance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "In a nutshell, computing the critical path involves 1) constructing a weighted DAG connecting all the operations, 2) finding the longest path in this DAG. The challenging part is constructing the DAG here. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes**: The Nodes in the critical path graph represent points in time. Each operator/kernel thus has two nodes viz. a begin and an end node. In case of nested operators we also link the nodes in the order they appear in the callstack. An example of stacked operators is shown below-\n",
    "```\n",
    "          |----------------------- Op A ----------------------|\n",
    "                    |--- Op B ---|        |-- Op C--|\n",
    "Critical Path Graph\n",
    "         (OpA.b)--->(ObB.b)----->(OpB.e)->(OpC.b)-->(OpC.e)->(OpA.e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edges** in this DAG can be one of two types\n",
    "1. Timing edges (weight = time): include durations for the operators/kernels as well as delays to launch operators between CPU and GPU.\n",
    "1. Dependency edges (weight = 0): do not have a time component but show a dependency between operations themselves. This includes data dependencies and synchronization between CPU and GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lightweight Critical Path\n",
    "Our initial implementation of Critical Path analysis does not consider dependency between PyTorch operators, this requires combining the trace with Chakra Execution Traces and processing Tensor information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is to simplify the dependency analysis between PyTorch operators\n",
    "- We assume that all CPU operators are dependent serially on the last operator that ran on a CPU thread. This frees us from attempting to correlate with Execution Traces.\n",
    "- The operator dependency part can be added back later.\n",
    "\n",
